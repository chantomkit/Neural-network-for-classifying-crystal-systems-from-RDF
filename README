Upon modification of the MNIST neural network, this neural network try to learn distinguishing different crystal system (out of 7 in total) from given RDF.
Firstly, I have used another algoritm (RDF generator) to extract information from the given structure.vasp file, and generate their respective RDF (features).
Secondly, the generated RDF (features) and its respective crystal system (labels) are put inside a tensor and store in a training_data.npy file.
Thirdly, the neural network (4 layers, fully connected) is trained by that given file.
The training_data.npy consists of ~7000 sets of RDF (features) and its designated crystal system (labels).
ULTIMATE GOAL: To increase the accuracy in testing samples, and to generalize in to classifying space groups (out of 230 in total) from RDF.
